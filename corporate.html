          <p><b>Brand Vision</b></p>
		  <p> In a world where hard rock fans are hard to find, we believe in putting them on the radar and creating a home where they truly belong. Because staying connected makes the experience even louder. </p>
			
	      <p><b>Brand values, each accompanied by a piece of compelling copy</b></p>
	      <p>Connection -Rock Radar embraces a sense of connection, bringing together a community of passionate rock fans who live for the energy and the authenticity of the scene. We bring people closer to the music and closer to each other, amplifying the bond that makes hard rock a way of life.</p>
	      <p>Passion - It's often said that hard rock is a lifestyle. It means that fans form an identity around the music, it is a way of expressing oneself. Hard rock music  has a lot of energy, the rush of the electric guitar, and the adrenaline of live concerts. Rock radar wants to keep this passion and energy alive through our platform.</p>
	      <p>Comfort - Many rock fans, especially those who don’t have like-minded people in their immediate surroundings, seek a place where they can feel understood and accepted. Rock Radar creates a comforting digital space where they can feel at home within the online presence of other fans.</p>
		   <p>Nostalgia - The golden age of hard rock, it’s a memory and a connection to something bigger. From discovering your favorite band to seeing them for the first time in concert, hard rock fans enjoy the nostalgia while staying connected to the present. Rock Radar keeps this nostalgia alive by bringing fans together and connecting over the music that has shaped them and make them proud to be a hard rock fan.</p>

          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p><b>Target Audience</b></p>
          <p>Our target audience consists of hard rock fans aged 18-60 who actively follow bands, attend concerts and engage with rock culture. We target music enthusiasts who value self-expression, boldness and the feeling of community. Our Brand persona you can find underneath; 
            Historically, the hard rock audience has been dominated by male and white as well as age is skewed a little older. Nowadays this has broadened its horizon, turning into younger audiences as well (Henry, 2012).
            There is also a difference within the community. Casual fans are attracted by outdoor concerts and festivals, where the overall atmosphere of the experience is very important. Loyal fans are more prone to bundled or packaged events with other relevant bands or experiences. And then we have the die hard fans who are tempted by VIP packages. </p>
			
		  <p> <b>Platform Usage</b></p>
		  <p>Hard rock fans interact with their favorite musicians through social media. We see that hard rock bands mostly use platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to share updates, tour dates, and behind the scenes content. So these platforms are mostly used to search and receive news (W.A, 2024).
			  Also platforms such as dedicated forums or Reddit are popular among the community for discussion, sharing experiences, or brand related content. These platforms foster a sense of community and here they communicate and try to connect with others (Culture Case, n.d.).
			  As to listening behaviors in hard rock fans, it shows that they use a mix of traditional and modern channels. Radio playing is an important part in listening as well as cd’s. </p>
			
		  <p> <b>Content Preferences</b></p>
		  <p>Fans show that they have a strong interest in exclusive content such as behind the scene footage, interviews with artists or bands, and live performance recording. They appreciate authenticity and value direct interactions with artists. There is also a strong engagement in online communities. Fans actively participate by sharing opinions on music quality, concert experiences, and personal stories related to their favorite bands. </p>
			
	      <p><b>Communication objectives</b></p>
	      <p>Reach</p>
	      <p>Our campaign will target a multi-platform approach to maximize audience reach:</p>
			<ul>
  <li>Instagram: 25 people through targeted posts and stories</li>
  <li>Reddit: 250 people via relevant hard rock community forums and threads</li>
  <li>Facebook: 1,200 people through dedicated hard rock groups and fan pages</li>
</ul>
          <p>This gives us a total potential reach of approximately 1,475 people who will see our message. We've established these targets based on Henry's (2012) demographic research on hard rock audiences and platform usage patterns among music fans. </p>
			
		  <p> Affect</p>
		  <p>Our campaign aims to create new connections between hard rock fans by creating a sense of community. We want hard rock fans to feel comfortable and have fun conversations with like minded people. According to Baym (2018), music communities thrive on shared experiences and exclusive content, which we'll leverage to create this emotional connection.</p>
		  <p>Response</p>
		  <p>We expect our audience to:</p>
		  <ul>
  <li>Be aware of our brand across platforms</li>
  <li>Visit and register on our website</li>
  <li>Spread word-of-mouth about Rock Radar within their own hard rock communities</li>
</ul>
		  <p> This response aligns with findings from Salo et al. (2013) that music fans actively share positive experiences with their peers when they feel part of an authentic community. We want to create that community for them.</p>
		  <p>Platforms</p>
		  <p>Based on our research into hard rock fan behaviors (W &amp; W, 2024; Culture.Case, n.d.), we've selected the following platforms:
		  <ul>
  <li>Instagram: For visual storytelling and brand promotion</li>
  <li>Facebook: For community building in established hard rock groups and broader reach</li>
  <li>Reddit: For in-depth discussions, community engagement, and connecting with dedicated hard rock enthusiasts</li>
</ul>
		  <p>According to Lingel and Naaman (2012), selecting platforms where audiences already gather is crucial for community-based marketing campaigns, which is why we chose Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit based on our research showing these are key channels for hard rock fans. </p>
			
	      <p> Campaign</p>
	      <p>What is the campaign about?
		      Our campaign will create excitement, connection and sense of coming home. The campaign is centered around creating as much brand awareness as possible.
		      Our campaign has two big components; platform integration, we want to establish a strong presence in Facebook groups, Reddit and Instagram to send out updates and engage with the community. And community building, to show that the brand connects our fans immediately, strengthen user engagement and the sense of community. </p>
			
			<p><b>What is the message?</b></p>
		  <p>The message we want to convey with this campaign is that we can bring together hard rock fans, especially if you don’t really have someone in your environment. Because staying connected makes the experience louder. </p>
			
		  <p><b>Objective described in smart method</b></p>
		  <p>Our campaign objectives follow the SMART methodology to make sure our goals are clear and measurable:</p>
		  <p>Specific: Launch the Rock Radar website with community-focused posts that bring hard rock fans together while creating our brand presence on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit.</p>
		  <p>Measurable: Reach 1,475 people through our platforms (25 on Instagram, 250 on Reddit, and 1,200 on Facebook) during our 4-week campaign from March 14 to April 11, 2025.</p>
		  <p>Achievable: We've set realistic reach numbers based on typical engagement rates for hard rock fans and chosen platforms where our target audience spends their time.</p>
		  <p>Relevant: Our campaign addresses the need for connection within the hard rock community, creating online opportunities for fans to engage with each other and our brand.</p>
		  <p>Time-bound: The campaign has a clear timeline, starting March 14 and ending with our website launch on April 11, giving us 4 weeks to build excitement.
			  Successfully launch the Rock Radar website by fostering a strong online community of hard rock fans through engaging content on Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit. Achieve a total reach of 1,475 people during our 4-week campaign (March 14 – April 11, 2025) while establishing our brand presence and driving traffic to the website.</p>
		  <p><b>Planning/Timeline</b></p>
		  <p>Our campaign will follow a strategic 4-week timeline designed to build momentum. Our platforms are visitable through these links, there are screenshots from our pages underneath:</p>
			
		  <p><b>Weekly layout</b></p>
			<p>Monday: Instagram &amp; Facebook post 1 - Tuesday: Reddit post 1 - Wednesday: Instagram &amp; Facebook post 2 - Thursday: Reddit Post 2 - Friday: Instagram &amp; Facebook post 3 </p>
			
			<img src="images/week1-socials.jpg" alt="week 1 socials">
			
		  <p>After our first week of promotion and reflecting on it, we came to a few conclusions. We noticed that reddit was not the platform to necessarily post advertisements. We also noticed that posting about our website, launch event and brand was too much for a 4 week campaign. Based on these reflections we adapted our marketing objectives and planning. Our main focus will be to give away the look and feel of our brand and show people what Rock Radar stands for. We will also adapt our posts more on the platform. On reddit we will focus on starting conversation and connecting with hard rock fans.</p>

		  <p>Questions for reddit (Tue+Thu):</p>
		  <p>1. What’s the best hard rock experience you’ve ever had and who was there with you?</p>
		  <p>2. If you could bring back one hard rock legend for a final concert, who would it be? </p>

	      <p>Questions for reddit (Tue+Thu):</p>
	      <p>1. What’s an unknown or not so popular hard rock album you think deserves way more recognition, and why?</p>
		  <p>2. What’s the first hard rock song that really hooked you into the genre?</p>

<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>Per platform we’ve analysed the interaction and reach of our posts.</p>
			
		<img src="images/instagram-learningpoints.jpg" alt="instagram learning points">
		<img src="images/facebook-learningpoints.jpg" alt="facebook learning points">
		<img src="images/reddit-learningpoints.jpg" alt="reddit learning points">

		  <p> After analysing these results we made a list with what worked well and what did not.</p>
		  <p><b>What worked well:</b></p>
		  <p>Reddit: With 8.9K views, Reddit surpassed our expectations and goal of 250 users for our reach objective.With 57 comments we can definitely say we succeeded in our affect objective. Through conversation starters and engaging, community-focused questions, we succeeded in sparking authentic dialogue among hard rock fans, showing that Rock Radar can connect hard rock fans. Our questions were based on nostalgia and connection, which also reflects upon our brand values.</p>
		  <p>Instagram: With a reach of 768 we successfully reached our objective of 25 people. Our posts showed visual consistency and it did show the voice and tone of our brand.</p>
		  <p><b>What did not work:</b></p>
		  <p>Facebook: Our goal to reach 1,200 people on Facebook was definitely not successful with a total reach of 271 people, this platform had the lowest engagement and traffic. Our tone did not translate well to Facebook groups, where promotional content is more easily dismissed.</p>
		  <p>Instagram: If we are being critical our content could be more variable and high quality. Our posts are all very much alike, as well as the message portrayed in every  post. We could have varied more in making some reels as well. We could have used funny memes, or high quality reels to engage people more on instagram. Because although we did reach 596 platforms, we did not get much response from them. And therefore we did not fully succeed in our affect and response objective.</p>
		  <p>Reddit: We tried putting advertisement messages on reddit that promoted our brand and website specifically, this got flagged and taken down. That made it very clear that we needed to change our approach to reddit. Our new strategy worked very well, although since our website is not online, we can not fully say we directed people towards our website with the campaign.</p>
			<p>Week 1: Halfway through our campaign we discovered that launching the brand, teasing the website, and announcing an event all at the same time diluted our  message. We adjusted our campaign because this volume of promotional content was too much for a 4-week campaign with a new brand.</p>
			
			
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>Based on what we learned, here's what we would do if the project continued:</p>
          <p>Our future content would follow a 60/30/10 rule: 60% community-focused content (fan stories, band spotlights), 30% interactive content (polls, questions), and only 10% direct promotion. Baym (2018) shows that this balance better serves community building while maintaining brand visibility. Per platform;</p>
          <p>Reddit</p>
          <p>We would continue sparking conversations on reddit, we’ve noticed the most interaction on this platform and it is a great community building for our brand. Although we would maybe also try to focus on directing people towards our brand and website. So instead of only sparking conversations with questions, we would post comments like; ''Which hard rock band has NEVER disappointed you? Also if you’re into discovering more of this kind of stuff, we’ve been cooking up some deep dives and underrated picks over at our site👉 rockradar.nl Let us know your pick below. We might feature it next…''</p>
          <p>Instagram</p>
          <p>From now on, our website is live, that means that we would start promoting our website and our service more. Our marketing campaign for the past 4 weeks has been focused solely on promoting our brand look and feel and connecting with fans. Now is the time to show what Rock Radar can actually do for the community through our website. We have learned from the previous weeks that we don’t get a lot of interaction on instagram. That is why we would also focus on more variable content, focus on reals and use trends within the community to gain more viewers. For example reals or trends that are already getting views or likes. We could make a reel of side-by-side photos or videos of classic rockers in the '80s vs. today. A trend that goes well, and also this plates into our value nostalgia.</p>
          <p>Facebook</p>
          <p>Facebook has given the least amount of interaction for us. Meaning we decrease our resources from this platform more to other platforms. Nonetheless contentwise just like instagram, we would focus more on promoting our website instead of our brand. We support focusing resources on platforms that generate higher quality engagement rather than just broader reach. Lastly, we would develop better ways to track not just reach but also engagement quality, sentiment, and community growth. Hanna et al. (2011) argue that engagement quality is a more meaningful standard than quantity for community-focused campaigns. </p>
